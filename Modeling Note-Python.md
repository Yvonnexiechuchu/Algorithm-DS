*This is a note for Python code that divided by different ML model. The note can be used as a cheat sheet during daily coding. I am consistently update the file throughout the whole learning process and practice.*

### Variable Selection
*with many variables, model tend to be: 1) Overfitting 2) Hard to maintain or implement 3)Hard to inteprete, multi-collinearity*
#### Forward stepwise 
```python

```
### Partition the data in a train and test set.
```python
from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split
## Carry out 80-20 partititioning with stratification
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split (X, y, test_size = 0.8, stratify = y)
## Create the final train and test basetables
train = pd.concat([X_train, y_train], axis=1)
test = pd.concat([X_test, y_test], axis=1)
```
### Logistic Regression
```python
## data preparation
from sklearn import linear_model
X = basetable[["predictor_1","predictor_2","predictor_3"]]`
y = basetable[["target"]]
## Create a logistic regression model logreg and fit it to the data.
logreg = linear_model.LogisticRegression()
logreg.fit(X, y)

## Assign the coefficients to a list coef instead of array
coef = logreg.coef_
for p,c in zip(predictors,list(coef[0])):
    print(p + '\t' + str(c))
    
## Print the intercept in the form of array
logreg.intercept_

## Make a prediction for each observation in new_data and assign it to predictions
predictions = logreg.predict(new_data)
predictions_probability = logreg.predict_proba(new_data)
```

## MODEL EVALUATION
### AUC-ROC CURVE,  checking any classification modelâ€™s performance
<https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-auc-roc-curve-68b2303cc9c5>
ROC is a probability curve and AUC represents degree or measure of separability. 
```python
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score
auc=roc_auc_score(true_y,predictions_proba_y)
##calculates the AUC of model that is built on a train set and evaluated on a test set:
auc_train, auc_test = auc_train_test(variables, target, train, test)
```
